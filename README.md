# 👁️ AI-Powered Face Recognition Attendance System

Say goodbye to proxy attendance and manual registers.
This project is a smart attendance system powered by machine learning, capable of detecting and recognizing faces in real-time to automate entry and exit logs.

## 🎯 What It Does
📌 Recognizes faces using KNN — no cards, no passwords.
📌 Records entry & exit times with one glance.
📌 Prevents duplicate registrations with intelligent face comparison.
📌 Supports multiple faces simultaneously in one frame.
📌 Speaks feedback when attendance is marked.
📌 Tracks attendance history for every individual.
📌 Summarizes presence/absence across days with P / A reports.
📌 Evaluates recognition accuracy with performance metrics.

## 🔍 Tech Behind the Scenes
Face Detection: face_recognition, Haar Cascades
Model: Custom KNN trained on face images
UI: OpenCV overlay with live camera feedback
Storage: CSV logs, Excel reports, Pickle encodings
